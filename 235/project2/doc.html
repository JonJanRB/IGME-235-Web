            <h2>Weird quirk of dom manipulation I encountered</h2>
            <p>
                Something I found to be frustrating was that using the innerHTML property of an elment
                was not good to use since it basically cleared the events of anything in it. This was
                confusing to figure out since it was not immediatly obvous of what was causing the buttons
                I was adding events to to have their onclick events become null. Not even AI knew what was
                going wrong so I figured it out on my own since its advice was not very helpful.
