        <h2 id="innerHTMLHell">Weird quirk of dom manipulation I encountered</h2>
        <p>
            Something I found to be frustrating was that using the innerHTML property of an elment
            was not good to use since it basically cleared the events of anything in it. This was
            confusing to figure out since it was not immediatly obvous of what was causing the buttons
            I was adding events to to have their onclick events become null. Not even AI knew what was
            going wrong so I figured it out on my own since its advice was not very helpful.
        </p>
        <h2>Creating Elements</h2>
        <img src="src/create-element.png" alt="Create Element function" class="landscape">
        <p>
            Something I found frustrating and a bit harder to read was making elements with attributes.
            It was quick and easy with innerHTML, but I avoided that because of the loss of data described
            <a href="#innerHTMLHell">above</a>. When adding attributes using the element variable, is meant
            I would have to define it, then set each attribute individually with its own code statement.
            <br>
            I wanted a way to create an element with a single code statement that could not lose any data in the process.
            So, I made a function that took in everything. It basically uses the bracket syntax to set properties based
            on the object you provide which would be key-value pairs of the attributes to set. You can even set the inner
            text using that object so it makes creating elements much more concise, easier to read, and quicker to write.
            <br>
            It even works with adding classes, datasets, and non-standard attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
            This image shows everything working as intended allowing for all the major things to be created for an element
            with only a single code statement.
        </p>
        <h2>Try Appending Elements</h2>
        <p>
            I noticed that sometimes there was data from the api that was null such as alternate titles. A normal person would
            probably just make an if statement for the thing that could be null and call it a day, but I decided I wanted to make
            an easy way to do this in one line that worked for any element rather than hard coding it every time. In that vain,
            I made a function called `tryAppend` which will create an element and append it to a parent element only if the specified data
            is present. If any of the included data is invalid, it will not create or append the element at all.
            This way, the HTML doesn't have any tags that are empty shells or contain the word "null" meaning it is more semantic and clean.
        </p>
        <h2>Foldable Things</h2>
        <img src="src/multiple-folds.png" alt="Multiple folds showcase" class="portrait">
        <p>
            I created a foldable mechanism that allowed for sections to be folded and unfolded. For styling, I basically created a finite state
            machine accros both css and javascript and I think it turned out pretty well. Something to note is that it is not hard coded, it
            supports any number of foldable sections, works with nested foldable sections, and can allow for multiple foldables to be open at once
            (even though I limited it to only have one unfolded at a time since I think it makes it easier for the user to understand that the filters
            and sorting won't work on the "Lists" section).
