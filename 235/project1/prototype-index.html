                        In the side-scrolling game called Geometry Dash, I created my own programming syntax using objects called triggers which I called "Buffscript". I used these triggers to make my own system for writing code which could be used to make much more complicated and advanced procedures possible. I created a game utilizing this syntax which took about 2 months and the final result was very well received gaining over 100k downloads on this server and receiving the rating "epic" which is a very prestigious award to be given to a level.

                        I learned many different skills from the experience. The most important skill is problem solving. Because this is just an editor inside of a game, there are many severe limitations. Being able to solve problems and figure out creative solutions was almost a given if I wanted to make anything in it. The other skill I learned from it was how to make an engaging game. Using feedback I received on my first level that I had posted using my syntax, I created a game which was very well received gaining over 100k downloads called Little Light.

                        Worked on a team creating a top down shooter. I specifically worked on the level editor which
                        gave the user a rich experience by using MonoGame.Forms which allowed for having MonoGame run
                        in a panel or control. Notable features included infinite map size, multiple layers, tile
                        texture manipulation, texture slicing, entity placement, and hitbox placement.

                        This was created during a 1 week game jam for an arcade machine. The theme was "up" and the game
                        had the player manipulate time and fling themselves up to avoid the white wave from below.
