        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            From the creator of Pony Island and The Hex comes the latest mind melting, 
            self-destructing love letter to video games. Inscryption is an inky black 
            card-based odyssey that blends the deckbuilding roguelike, escape-room 
            style puzzles, and psychological horror into a blood-laced smoothie. Darker 
            still are the secrets inscrybed upon the cards...

        <h2>Review</h2>
        <blockquote>
            When I was first assigned this game for review, I thought that it might
            be just another card drawing and puzzle affair that seem to be common
            these days. However, Inscryption kept my attention until the very end.
            The plot, the dark theme, and the mysterious mechanics is so well thought
            out that I have to give it an enthusiastic two thumbs up. The only downside
            that I can think of is that replayability might be limited after the first
            couple of play throughs. Even with that said, this title is worth the price
            of admission.
